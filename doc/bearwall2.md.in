# DESCRIPTION

@PKGNAME@ is a firewall builder that allows you to easily manage complex
security policy on a linux host by separating your policies into reusable
classes and rulesets.

@PKGNAME@ reads in your firewall policy, defined in Bash, and generates the
appropriate `nftables(8)` chains and rules to implement consistent policy for a
dual-stacked host.

# FILES

The following directories contains policy files that will need to be created to
match the desired policy for your host.

`@CONFDIR@/interfaces.d/*.if`
:   The **interfaces.d** directory contains a file for each interface you want
    configured.

    Typically you would create a symlink (for example, named *eth0.if*) that
    points to one of the templates in **classes.d** (such as *external*).

    You can also apply common policy to multiple interfaces on a machine by
    adding those policies to a *localhost.if* file. See the **HOST RULES**
    section for more details.

The following directories do not need to be modified unless you
want to change the default behaviour of the firewall.

`@CONFDIR@/classes.d/*`
:   The **classes.d** directory contains templates for different types of interfaces.

    Example templates include *external*, *internal*, *loopback* and *vpn*.

`@BASEDIR@/ruleset.d/*.rule`
:   Default rulesets shipped with @PKGNAME@ are stored in this directory.

`@CONFDIR@/ruleset.d/*.rule`
:   Users can write their own rulesets and add them into this directory.

    See the **RULESETS** section for more details on the default rulesets.

# INTERFACE RULES

An interface rule file allows you to apply policy to an individual network
interface. Interface rule files are placed in **@CONFDIR@/interface.d/**.
The file name is the interface name followed by *.if*, e.g. eth0.if.

An interface rule file is a list of policies and features that should be enabled
on that interface. Policies are applied in order, top to bottom, so be careful
what order you specify the rules in.

This syntax of the interface rule file is as follows:

**policy** *chain* *match* *action*
:   Where *chain* is one of **in**, **out**, **inout**, **forward-in**,
    **forward-out**, **prerouting**, or **postrouting**.

    When writing a **RULESET**, *chain* may be omitted so that the policy could
    be applied to any chain.

    Where *match* is either a *named rule-set* (in all capital letters, without
    the ".rule"), or a standard `nftables(8)` expression
    (such as **tcp dport ssh**).

    Where *action* is a standard `nftables(8)` statement such as **accept**,
    **drop**, **reject**, etc.

**policy\_log** *chain* *match* *action*
:   This is a different variant of **policy** that causes packets that match the
    policy to be logged as well as having the *action* applied.

    For more information see the **LOGGING** section.

    Note: *chain*, *match* and *action* are the same as for **policy**.

**if\_feature** *feature* *value*
:   Where *feature* is one of the settings supported by your kernel (look in
    /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/ and /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/)

    Where *value* is the appropriate integer for that feature.

# HOST RULES

In the same way we can apply policies to individual interfaces, we can also
apply common policy to multiple interfaces on the machine.

This is done by creating a special *localhost.if* file in
**@CONFDIR@/interface.d/**.

The syntax for this file is the same as an interface rule file, however there is
one limitation: rules can only be added to the in and out chains.

Take a look at **@CONFDIR@/classes.d/host** for an example host rule file.

Once we have defined our host policy, we need to apply this to some interfaces.
We can do this by adding a special policy to our *interface*.if files:

```
policy inout host
```

# RULESETS

@PKGNAME@ ships a few default rulesets that we find useful that you can use
as part of your firewall configuration:

icmp-safe.rule
:   Accept safe types of ICMP/ICMPv6 messages.

martians.rule
:   Reject packets with a source or destination address in private RFC1918 space.

reject-ms.rule
:   Reject ports used by Microsoft protocols that have been affected by worms
    or other vulnerabilities in the past.

ssh-limit.rule
:   Limit ssh connection attempts to 10 per second per host.

stateful.rule
:   Use conntrack state to allow connections to pass.

If you want to provide your own rulesets, put them in **@CONFDIR@/ruleset.d**
and reference them like you would a normal ruleset.
Check any of the above default rulesets for an example of how to write one.

# EXAMPLES

## Getting started with @PKGNAME@

After installing @PKGNAME@, getting your first firewall policies applied
is quite straight-forward.

We will be creating firewall policy for *lo* (used for loopback traffic on the
machine) and *eth0* (external Internet-facing network interface).

We will be using two predefined classes *loopback* for *lo* and *external* for
*eth0*. Creating a symlink from the class to the interface rule file allows us
to re-use the class for multiple interfaces.

```
$ ln -s /etc/bearwall2/classes.d/loopback /etc/bearwall2/interfaces.d/lo.if
$ ln -s /etc/bearwall2/classes.d/external /etc/bearwall2/interfaces.d/eth0.if
```

If you want to see what rules are going to applied look at the contents of these
two files.

Note: If you are remotely logged into the machine you are running these commands
on, make sure you have edited the *external* class and have a policy that allows
that traffic.

To apply the new policies, we can run @PKGNAME@ with the `try` command:

```
$ sudo @PKGNAME@ try
```

This will temporarily apply the new policies, rolling back to the old firewall
state after 30 seconds in case we accidentally block our access to the machine.

If we are happy with the new policies we can cancel the rollback by running
commit:

```
$ sudo @PKGNAME@ commit
```

For more examples, see the sample files in the **@CONFDIR@/classes.d** directory.

## Writing rules for dual-stack hosts

In nftables, both IPv4 and IPv6 packets will traverse the same set of rules.

Rules specifically targeting IPv4 packets won't affect IPv6 packets
(and vice versa).

Rules that don't match IPv4 or IPv6 specifically will affect
both kinds of packets.

Some examples of @PKGNAME@ rules that demonstrate this behaviour:

```
# this rule only affects IPv4 packets
policy in ip version 4 udp dport 40 accept

# this rule only affects IPv6 packets
policy in ip6 version 6 udp dport 60 accept

# this rules affects both IPv4/IPv6 packets
policy in udp dport 100 accept
```

## More Advanced Example

This creates an empty ruleset with no rules in it, and then we can use
nftables as normal to add/delete rules to the chain.

In a newly created **ruleset.d/ssh\_syn.rule**:

```
# automatically create an empty 'ssh_syn' chain we can use
register
```

And in our **@CONFDIR@/interfaces.d/eth0.if** file add a policy that jumps to
this empty chain:

```
policy in tcp dport ssh tcp flags syn SSH_SYN
```

Then to add an ip address that we do not want to have ssh access:

```
$ sudo nft add rule inet bearwall ssh_syn ip saddr 192.168.0.1/32 drop
```

# LOGGING


@PKGNAME@ will log packets matched by any rule created by using the
**policy\_log** statement, as well as any packet dropped by the rulesets
provided with @PKGNAME@.

If you see any log messages with the prefix `End of forward`, this means you
have packets falling through the firewall chain without having any action
applied to them.

By default, @PKGNAME@ ships with firewall packet logging disabled. This is
because the default destination for packet logging is dmesg which isn't ideal.

We can improve this by using the userspace daemon ulog2 to log packets to a
file instead of dmesg.

To do this, first install ulog2:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ulogd2
```

Then we need to tell @PKGNAME@ where to log by editing
**@CONFDIR@/@PKGNAME@.conf** and setting: **logging=nflog**.

By default ulog2 will log to **/var/log/ulog/syslogemu.log**. You can configure
the destination ulogd2 logs to by editing **/etc/ulogd.conf**.
