#
# Example class suitable for using as localhost.if. localhost.if is a special
# interface file which represents common configuration for this host and is
# applied whenever an in interface uses the "policy host*" targets.
#
# On a simple host you may choose not to include localhost.if and just use
# all configuration on the interfaces, but when you have multiple public
# interfaces which may have some local rules and some shared rules, you
# can use this for the shared rules, and include them amounst the local rules
# where appropriate. The localhost file should not include termination policy
# like "policy in accept" or "policy out reject" so that interfaces can put
# rules after the host policy if it chooses.
#
# This file should only have in, out and inout policy types. All other types are
# invalid for localhost policy
#

policy in STATEFUL

policy inout REJECT-MS

policy out accept


# This file should not contain any interface features as this is not a real
# interface.
