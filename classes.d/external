#
# Example class suitable for application to your external internet interface
# eg. ppp0
#
# All traffic leaving via this interface is MASQUERADED
#

# Apply common host policy (from localhost.if) to in & out direction
#policy inout host
# Apply common host policy (from localhost.if) to in direction
#policy in host
# Apply common host policy (from localhost.if) to out direction
#policy out host

# Host apply default rules after host policy
policy in reject
policy out accept

# Masquerade any traffic leaving onto the IP of this interface
policy postrouting masquerade
# If you want to restrict external access further you can add an extra
# option such as 'ip saddr 10.1.1.0/24' (no quotes) to the above command before
# the masquerade verdict target

# Advanced Configuration Examples

# Portforward external port 1234 to 1.2.3.4:5678
#policy prerouting tcp dport 1234 dnat 1.2.3.4:5678

# Having issues with stupid people breaking path MTU?
# policy out ip daddr 1.2.3.4 tcp flags syn tcp option maxseg size set 576

# Allow any traffic generated on this machine out to the Internet
policy out accept

# Keep the internet clean - block known MS worm traffic
policy forward REJECT-MS

# Act as a good little router for all other traffic
policy forward accept
